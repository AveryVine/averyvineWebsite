For the past four months, I've spend each and every weekday at TripAdvisor Canada. I can honestly say that my coworkers were a group of people that inspired me to be a better programmer. Each day, I was amazed by their incredibly deep knowledge of such a wide variety of programming-related topics, their astute problem-solving abilities, and their dedication to their craft. This created a work atmosphere that I would look forward to being a part of every day.<!--more-->

This past Friday was my last day at TripAdvisor Canada. I'm incredibly thankful for the time that I've spent with these individuals, especially those on my team: Jason, Madhur, Bryan, Nikolai, Nikta, and Evgeny. They helped me get involved with some of the most important and impactful work that I've ever done, and guided me through the sea of complex production and dev architecture so I could complete my tasks. I look forward to seeing each and every one of them in four months, when I plan to return to TripAdvisor for another co-op work term - this time at the Needham, MA headquarters!
